### Exported <code>will-file</code> (<code>out-will-file</code>)

<code>Out-will-file</code> is a variety of <code>will-file</code> which was generated by the utility while exporting the module. Other modules can use this module by importation of its <code>out-will-file</code>.

The out-will file is generated from the original file by completely duplicating it and supplementing information such as:

- List of exported files.
- The current version of the module.
- Format version.
- The location of the original `will file`.

All this information is recorded in the [exported](SectionExported.md) section of the generated file.
