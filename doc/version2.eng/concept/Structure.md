# Inner structure

### Section of the <code>will-file</code>  

The highest structural unit of the <code>will-file</code>, which consists of one-type resources or fields that describe this module.   

There are 6 sections for constructing the module: `about`,` path`, `submodule`,` step`, `reflector`,` build` and the `exported` section which is generated only by exporting the module.

#### Schematic structure of `will-files`

```
will-file
    ├── about
    ├── submodule
    ├── path
    ├── reflector
    ├── step
    ├── build
    └── exported

```

The figure depicts all sections of `will-file`. None of the sections is required for use `will-file`. However for execution of some commands the presence of some of them is necessary. For example, for the module's export `will-file` must have the name and version specified in the` about`.

### Sections assignment of `will-file`

<details>
  <summary><a href="./concept/SectionAbout.md">Section <code>about</code></a></summary>
  Section consist descriptive information about the module.
</details>
<details>
  <summary><a href="./concept/ResourcePath.md#Секція-path">Section <code>path</code></a></summary>
 The section contains a list of paths of the module for quick orientation in its file structure.
</details>
<details>
  <summary><a href="./concept/Submodule.section.md">Section <code>submodule</code></a></summary>
  The section contains information about the submodule.
</details>
<details>
  <summary><a href="./concept/ResourceStep.md#Секція-step">Section <code>step</code></a></summary>
The section contains steps that can be used by the build to build the module.
</details>
<details>
  <summary><a href="./concept/ResourceReflector.md#Секція-reflector">Section <code>reflector</code></a></summary>
  The section contains reflectors, it is resources for implementation of the operations at file groups.
</details>
<details>
  <summary><a href="./concept/ResourceBuild.md#Секція-build">Section <code>build</code></a></summary>
  Section resources (builds) describe the sequence and conditions for executing the module creation procedures.
</details>
<details>
  <summary><a href="./concept/SectionExported.md">Section <code>exported</code></a></summary>
  The <code>out-will-file</code> section is generated by the program while the module is exported, it contains a list of all exported files and is used by importing this module to others.
</details>

### Example of `will-file`:  

![will.file.inner.png](./Images/will.file.inner.png)  

At the figure the `will-file` with 4 sections and several resources is shown.

### Resources

  Structural and functional unit of <code>will-file</code>. In the file, resources of the same type are collected in one section.

The resources of the sections are denoted declaratively, namely, the desired result is indicated, rather than the sequence of instructions for obtaining this result.

The appearance of the resources of individual sections is different.

![resource.png](./Images/resource.png)  

At the figure, the resource of type of the submodule `Tools` is located in the section` submodule` has a shortened form of the record whereas the resource type step `npm.install` placed in the` step` section has a full (extended) record form.

### Type of resource

Functionality is associated with a group of resources, limited to the purpose. An example of which types of resources are: path, submodule, step, build. Each type of resource has its own purpose and is processed by utility in different ways.

### Resources by type

<details>
  <summary><a href="./ResourcePath.md.md#Ресурс-шлях">Type of resources <code>path</code></a></summary>
Describe the file structure of the module, indicating the paths to the files of the module.
</details>
<details>
  <summary><a href="./ResourceStep.md#Ресурс-крок">Type of resources <code>step</code></a></summary>
The resource for the <code>step</code> section, which is an instruction for executing by the utility while constructing of the module. Describe the operations and the desired result. The builds consist of steps.
</details>
<details>
  <summary><a href="./ResourceReflector.md#Ресурс-рефлектор">Type of resources <code>reflector</code></a></summary>
  Designated for the build of the group of files to carry out any operation at them.
</details>
<details>
  <summary><a href="./SubmodulesLocalAndRemote.md">Type of resources <code>submodule</code></a></summary>
  They are links to other modules that can be used as submodules of this module.
</details>
<details>
  <summary><a href="./ResourceBuild.md#Ресурс-збірка">Type of resources <code>build</code></a></summary>
  Contains a list of steps that need to be taken to build a module.
</details>
<details>
  <summary><a href="./ResourceBuild.md#Ресурс-експорт">Type of resources <code>export</code></a></summary>
  This is a special kind of build, the result of which is the generated `out-will-file` that can be used by another module.
</details>
<details>
  <summary><a href="./SectionExported.md#Секція-exported">Type of resources <code>exported</code></a></summary>
  This resource is generated when the module is exported and only available in the generated files. The <code>out-will-file</code> has exactly the same amount of resources as <code>exported</code> as the number of times that the module was exported for different exports. Resources of this type include descriptive fields and a list of exported files.
