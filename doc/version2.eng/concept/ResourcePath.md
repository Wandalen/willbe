# Resource and section path

### Resource path

Resource for determination of file structure of the module, which includes paths to the files. The paths are placed in the section <code>path</code>.

Resource path, as well as the other types of resources can have criterions, path and inheritance. In short form of writing, this resource has only path.

### Example

![section.path.png](./Images/section.path.png)

It contains section `path` with paths `in`, `out`, `toDelete`. The path `toDelete` is written in open format and has a field with description.

### Fields of resources of section `path`

| Field      | Description                                        |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| path           | Path to the file  |
| description    |Description of directory                             |
| criterion      | Condition of using of resource (see [criterion](Criterions.md)) |
| inherit        | Inheritance from another resource   |

### Predefined paths

Module contains next predefined paths which are available for using:

- `path::in` - basic path, all another reference paths of this module which begin their readout with respect to  `path::in`. `path::in` are the reference path with respect to `path::predefined.dir`. Developer can set any path`path::in` in `will-файлі`. If `in` is not specified, `willbe` begins readout from the path `path::predefined.dir`.
- `path::out` - directory, in which utility will put `out-will-file` and other files which were generated by exportation of the module. As all another reference paths, `path::out` is the reference path with respect to `path::in`. Developer can set any `path::out` in `will-file`.
- `path::temp` - the files which have this path are deleted by cleaning. If `path::temp` is not set, then cleaning deletes only uploaded modules, `out-will-file` and generated archives if they are.
- `path::predefined.will.files` - the path to `will-files`, with respect to which the command is implemented. It is defined by utility by implementation of the command.
- `path::predefined.dir` - the path to directory with files, at which the command of utility is implemented. It is determined by utility by implementation of the command.
- `path::predefined.remote` - specified by developer URI-link on remote resource for loading files of the module.
- `path::predefined.local` - specifies directory, in which utility will put downloaded from remote resource files. It is determined by developer by implementation of downloading of the files from remote resource.
- `path::predefined.willbe` - specifies the place of implementing file of the utility `willbe`. It is not possible to edit, it is determined by system.

### Section <code>path</code>

Section contains the list of the paths of the module for quick orientation in its file structure.
