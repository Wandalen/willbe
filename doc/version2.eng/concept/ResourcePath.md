# Resource and section path

### Resource path

Resource for determination of the module's file structure. It includes paths to the module files. The paths are placed in the section <code>path</code>.

Resource path, as well as the other types of resources can have criterions, path and inheritance. In short form of writing, this resource has only path.

### Example

![section.path.png](./Images/section.path.png)

The example contains section `path` with paths `in`, `out`, `toDelete`. The path `toDelete` is written in extended format and has a description field.

### Fields of resources of section `path`

| Field          | Description                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| path           | Path to the file                            |
| description    | Description of the directory                |
| criterion      | Condition of resource using (see [criterion](Criterions.md)) |
| inherit        | Inheritance from another resource   |

### Predefined paths

Module contains next predefined paths which are available for using:
- `path::in` - basic path, all another relative paths of this module begin their readout with respect to `path::in`. `path::in` is the relative path with respect to `path::predefined.dir`. Developer can set any path`path::in` in the `will-file`. If `path::in` is not specified, `willbe` begins readout from the path `path::predefined.dir`.
- `path::out` - directory, in which utility will put `out-will-file` and other files which were generated by export of a module. As all another relative paths, `path::out` is the relative path with respect to `path::in`. Developer can set any `path::out` in `will-file`.
- `path::temp` - the files which have this path are deleted by cleaning. If `path::temp` is not set, then cleaning deletes only downloaded modules, `out-will-file` and generated archives if they are.
- `path::predefined.will.files` - the path to current `will-files`, with respect to which the command is implemented. It is determined by utility while implementing the command.
- `path::predefined.dir` - the path to directory with `will-files`, at which the command of utility is implemented. It is determined by utility while the command implementation.
- `path::predefined.remote` - specified by developer URI-link on remote resource for downloading files of the module.
- `path::predefined.local` - specifies directory, in which utility will put downloaded files from remote resource. It is determined by developer to download files from a remote resource.
- `path::predefined.willbe` - specifies the place of the executable file of the utility `willbe`. It is not edited and is determined by the system.

### Section <code>path</code>

Section has the list of the module paths for quick orientation in its file structure.
