# Section <code>about</code>

The section contains descriptive information about the module.

The section has no resources. Furthermore is can have any structure from arrays and maps having any form of nesting. If a build parameter is not the path and if a user does not know where it should be written, then he writes it to the "about" section. The data in this section can be used in steps, for example, the `about :: keyword / 0` selector will use the first keywords.

### Example

```yaml
about :

    name : aboutSection
    description : "Example of about section"
    version : 0.0.1
    keyword :
      - willbe

```

The `about` section has 4 fields among which are the module name, description, version and one keyword.

### Fields of the `about` section, which can be used by default
