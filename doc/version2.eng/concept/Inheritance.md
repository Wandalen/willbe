# Resources inheritance  

Approach of description of a module according to wich <code>will-file</code> can reuse (inherit) value of fields of other resource(s) of the same type.


By inheritance, the resource is able to alter and complement inherited resource. Inheritance by resources allows repeatedly use the resources of  `will-file`, which are built by user and are generated by exportation of the module, what facilitates construction of the module.
At the diagram is shown as relate resource which is followed with resource which follows.

### Properties:

- resource, which follows can change the resource which is followed;
- resource, which follows can complement the resource which is followed ;
- there are resources, which takes parameters - criterions, paths and so on;
- parameters are given in resource which follows.

### Using of inheritance by resources

For using of inheritance by resources in within the borders of one `will-file` is needed:
- specify the resource which will be followed;
- if needed, change or complement the field of resource
For using of inheritance by resources from another `will-file` is needed:
- connect external `will-file` as submodule of the section `submodule`;
- specify in field `inherit` the path to the resource, which will be followed. The path has a formulation:`submodule::NameOfSubmodule/section::NameOfSection/NameOfResource`, which means that submodule, section and resource are specified clearly;
-if needed, specify criterions and complement the fields of the resource.
