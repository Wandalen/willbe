# Resources inheritance  

Approach of description of a module according to which <code>will-file</code> can reuse (inherit) value of fields of other resource(s) of the same type.

By inheritance, the resource is able to alter and complement inherited resource. Inheritance by resources allows repeated use of the resources of the `will-file` which are built by user and generated by exportation of the module. It facilitates construction of the module.
The diagram below shows the relation of the resource which is followed with the resource which follows.

### Properties:

- following resource can change followed resource.
- following resource can complement followed resource.
- there are resources, which takes parameters - criterions, paths and so on;
- parameters are given in resource which follows.

### Using of the resources which belong the same module

For the use of inheritance by resources within the borders of one `will-file` the following steps are required:
- specify the resource which will be followed;
- if needed, change or complement the field of resource

### Using of the resources which belong the different module

For the use of inheritance by resources from another `will-file` the following steps are required:
- connect external `will-file` as submodule of the section `submodule`;
- specify in field `inherit` the path to the resource, which will be followed.   For example`inherit:submodule::NameOfSubmodule/section::NameOfSection/NameOfResource`, which means that submodule, section and resource are specified clearly;
- if needed, specify criterions and complement the fields of the resource.
